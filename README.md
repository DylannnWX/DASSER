Welcome to DASSER 3000 (Dylanâ€™s Alternative Splice Site ExchangeR Supreme 3000)!

This is a side project I did for benchtop scientists (e.g. my friend Ko-Wei Liu, Ph.D. in Dr. Eric Smith lab at Dana Farber) who frequently need to design plasmid and swap codons with potential alternative splice sites. This process is extremely labor-extensive if done by hand as they would need to look up the codon swap chart and manually try every single combination until the predicted alternative splice site disappears.

With this Jupyter Notebook, instead of spending hours on a construct, now you can simply upload the predicted alternative splice site chart and construct sequence (in FASTA format), then press enter. 

In addition, you can swap multiple constructs at the same time by concating them into a single FASTA file and predict the alternative splice sites together!

This is now actively being used by Ko-Wei and other members in Dr. Eric Smith lab. As a bioinformatic scientist, I always try to make benchtop scientists' lives easier by streamlining processes by programming. Feel free to use it if you also need to swap codons due to alternative splice sites.
